We have started opening more in summer 2020 (this post is an example) as things start to line up. Some of the folks in the Languages do give talks Motoko and Wasm... and expect us to open up further.<p>I do not expect that answer will truly sate your curiosity, and I am very humbled you are even interested to read the code and go deep. That means a lot, thank you.",
  "https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=24298808": "<br /><br />Hi there! Diego from DFINITY here...<p>1. Compared to other forms of DECENTRALIZED compute, IC + Motoko shines in making web apps with User experience comparable to centralized providers (AWS, GCP, Azure). Example: You can build simple react web social network and expect quick reads (in milliseconds) and writes (1-3 seconds). Note I did not say &quot;blocks&quot; or &quot;finalization.&quot; I deliberately trying not to have a leaky abstraction from the POV of the app developer.<p>Compared to CENTRALIZED compute, you can create &quot;open internet services&quot; like an open version of TikTok where the control of the app and its features can be be done by (in simple terms) voting. Example: <a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_MkRszZw7hU\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.youtube.com&#x2F;watch?v=_MkRszZw7hU</a><p>More broadly, one of the things that is surprising (it was to me when I joined, and it still is), how much of the cloud stack that developers or compute providers create is not necessary when you have protocol-based compute. As a developer, some things like firewalls, databases, seem less important in enforcing the security and scalability of my apps. I realize as I type this can sound a bit naive AND esoteric... and I think the only way to really show this is by action and folks just playing with it. Few words will really convey this as much as people playing with it directly, I get that.<p>2. Our compute model are &quot;canisters&quot; which (if you are familiar with actor model) are actors that contain both their code and their state. Actors communicate by sending messages to each other (as actor model implies). Example: I could create a twitter canister. Orthogonal persistance means its state can grow without me spinning up DBs or worrying about replication and consistency.<p><a href=\"https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdk.dfinity.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-guide&#x2F;motoko.html#_orthogonal_persistence\" rel=\"nofollow\">https:&#x2F;&#x2F;sdk.dfinity.org&#x2F;docs&#x2F;language-guide&#x2F;motoko.html#_ort...</a><p>3.

The use-case escapes me completely,</i><p>Generally the use case for decentralized systems is if you want to disintermediate an existing middle-man who has proven untrustworthy, expensive, or problematic in some way.  Or, you want to enable a group of parties to coordinate their activities in ways not previously possible without a (currently non-existing) trusted intermediary.  The middle-man function is automated and federated.  That\u2019s it.<p>Any business model dependent on a middle-man is potentially a business model for decentralized systems, if the economics, risks and feature requirements compare favorably.  Bitcoin addressed arguably the most impactful one - money - but there may be others.<p><i>&gt;this even seems more useless than Ethereum, where I can see at least some applications thanks to the blockchain.</i><p>DFINITY is a \u201cblockchain\u201d in the general meaning of the word, aka a public decentralized computing platform with a native currency and attendent economic incentives.

How is iOS fundamentally different from the Xbox OS?  Microsoft owns the OS and the hardware.  Microsoft have several variants of the Xbox hardware for sale, and have a complete monopoly on digital game distribution through their OS.<p>&gt;Apple is not a minority by any stretch. They own half of the smartphones sold in US and a significant share in the world. If I am a platform like Spotify I have to be on it, otherwise I lose a significant userbase. Adding to this, a service like Hey saw 90% of the revenue come from iPhones. They were signing up users on the web, just turns out that 90% of their paying users had iPhones.<p>According to IDC[0], Apple commands 14.4% of the worldwide market share.  In the US, Apple commands a little under half [1].  Apple is unequivocally a minority player in the smartphone market.<p>&gt;Adding to that, Spotify has to compete with Apple Music which doesn&#x27;t pay the 30% tax, gets free placement on the phone and store and deep integrations with their product.<p>Spotify chooses to not deeply integrate with Apple.  WatchOS allowed third party streaming several years ago and Spotify is one of the few music services out there that still refuse to support it.  That&#x27;s on Spotify and Spotify alone.  The lack of a fee on the store could be considered unfair, but is no more fair or unfair than Google offering a music service, which they do.<p>&gt;As a developer does this seem fair to you?<p>Not really, but that is beside the point to me.  We have a free market and there are alternatives to Apple.  If Apple has a monopoly then I think we need to fundamentally blow up this entire market, because by that definition nearly every tech company out there has a monopoly.  I believe this line of reasoning would forbid Epic from exclusively selling cars in Rocket League, and I find that absurd.

This will keep it installed, but hide it from the main screens.<p>2. Launch the &quot;Shortcuts&quot; app (pre-installed on iOS) and create a new shortcut.<p>3.

Now the shortcut will read &quot;Open [Choose]&quot;. Select the &quot;Choose&quot; link and find the app that you previously moved to the App Library.<p>5. That is all that your shortcut will do, is simply open an app when invoked.<p>6. Before saving, click the Ellipses icon (the circle with 3 horizontal dots in it) that is located near the top-right of the card, across from &quot;New Shortcut&quot;<p>7. Click &quot;Add to Home Screen&quot;<p>8. This will open another card that allows you to customize the home screen presence. Give the icon the name that matches the app<p>9. Tap the app icon, and select &quot;Choose Photo&quot;. Find the photo of the app icon you want to use (you will need to previously have saved this to your phone)<p>10. Finally select &quot;Add&quot; on the top right of the screen.

Microsoft does not allow any other company to distribute digital games for Microsoft consoles.  You, nor anyone else, may create an Xbox store and sell digital games that will run on Xbox consoles.<p>&gt;I think the analogy doesn&#x27;t fit. Like a laptop&#x2F;desktop, smartphones are general computing platforms. Specific purpose devices like iPods, Nintendo Switch really doesn&#x27;t fit into this category much less a game.<p>If smartphones are computing platforms, then Apple doesn&#x27;t have a monopoly, because then you can choose another computing platform.  Apple products as computing platforms are an extreme minority.  In order for Apple to have a monopoly you have to redefine the platform to be the App Store specifically.  If you redefine the terms to just be the App Store, then that same definition would, and should, apply to any digital store.<p>Should Microsoft and Sony be forced to allow the Steam Store within their respective consoles?  Maybe?  But perhaps that is the fate Microsoft is trying to avoid and why Microsoft aren&#x27;t going nuclear on Apple.<p>&gt;The last thing I would want is for few companies to own everything, everyone should get a chance to compete on equal terms.<p>Is that not what we have?

I can see how the definition of communicate could be exploited to allow apps to override permission defaults set by Apple. For example perhaps you get an add and the app owner things it\u2019s valid to start the microphone so the communication channel can be opened? Perhaps I want to communicate based on location? Should I be allowed to access GPS information without permissions?<p>&gt; No app store owner or its platform should engage in self-preferencing its own apps or services, or interfere with users\u2019 choice of preferences or defaults.<p>Why? It\u2019s their platform. Developers are free to develop their own phone &#x2F; OS, right?<p>&gt; No developer should be required to pay unfair, unreasonable or discriminatory fees or revenue shares, nor be required to sell within its app anything it doesn\u2019t wish to sell, as a condition to gain access to the app store.<p>Apple would surely say developers do not pay an unfair or unreasonable amount. Who sets this standard?<p>&gt; No app store owner should prohibit third parties from offering competing app stores on the app store owner\u2019s platform, or discourage developers or consumers from using them.<p>Why?

You even seem to make this point yourself:<p>&gt; For some codebases, it might make sense to have a test (whether you want to call it integration or unit) that hits the database...<p>&gt; There&#x27;s no such thing as not testing anything else -- even if you&#x27;re testing a pure function in a functional language, you&#x27;re still going to be pulling in behavior from the OS, from your runtime environment, etc.<p>I don&#x27;t see how this point adds to the conversation around automated testing and different types of testing. Sometimes we mock the database to make tests faster. And sometimes we even mock the OS. I just recently wrote a test that mocks the filesystem. And I didn&#x27;t have to do any work to do that. There&#x27;s already a package available that does it for me.<p>&gt; Units are built out of units! Almost every useful unit test will encompass multiple smaller units of code.<p>This seems like another point that doesn&#x27;t add to the conversation around how to write useful tests. It sounds like pedantry around definitions to me, but maybe I&#x27;m missing some nuanced point that you&#x27;re trying to make.<p>&gt; The unit&#x2F;integration test distinction takes something that is fundamentally a continuum and turns it into a binary yes&#x2F;no question.<p>That&#x27;s a fair observation. Binary definitions are also extremely useful in some cases. Sometimes you need to know whether something is black or white and there is simply a cutoff point between the two. That&#x27;s useful in all sorts of situations in life, including talking about tests.<p>&gt; This leads to dogmatism, where people make bad testing choices purely because, &quot;by definition, my integration test can&#x27;t mock this 3rd-party service that obviously should be mocked.&quot;<p>That&#x27;s not what leads to dogmatism. If the best test for the purpose needs to hit the database, just call it an integration test. What exactly is the problem?<p>&gt; In contrast, if you spend all your time thinking about tests purely in terms of refactorability, reliability, and coverage...<p>Those are good factors to consider. So is the time it takes to run tests. If I can run my unit tests in a few seconds, I will use them often. My current end-to-end tests take well over 30 minutes to run. They obviously do not get run hundreds of times a day. So there is very useful conversation around what we want to include in our end-to-end tests, and more importantly what we want to exclude. And without definitions like &quot;unit test&quot; and &quot;end-to-end&quot; test, those conversations would be needlessly awkward and take longer. Hopefully no one is suggesting we drop &quot;unit tests&quot; in favor of a &quot;the tests that run super fast and before code merge&quot; category?<p>When someone on my team says &quot;let&#x27;s leave that out of the end-to-end tests and just write some unit tests to cover this lesser used feature&quot; everyone on the team knows exactly what to do. It&#x27;s not really that hard to develop a shared and useful testing vocabulary on a team, and that shared vocabulary can and should come from the widely used definitions already out there.

For example, in Dfinity they use threshold signatures. If any m of n stakers submit their part of the signature, a random number is created; no smaller subset of stakers can predict what that number will be, and the number is the same regardless of which stakers submit. (The number is used to choose the staker who produces the block.)<p>A similar attack is to sign multiple histories, so regardless of which is accepted, you get some reward. In Ethereum, if you do this then you&#x27;re penalized, losing some or all of your stake (depending on size of the attack). Any staker can see the evidence that you signed conflicting histories, and submit the evidence to the winning chain, receiving a small reward for doing so and destroying your stake.",

But the risk of collusion decreases very quickly even with relatively limited amounts of decentralization. E.g. a consortium of even 10 independent banks would be much less likely to steal your money than Wells Fargo alone. So while there will always be some use cases where power users will want to validate the entire chain, in practice I think we can get 99% of the benefits of decentralization with even a handful of nodes. Bitcoin wouldn&#x27;t be trustworthy under this model since anyone can jump in and mine, but it&#x27;s possible to create networks that are trustworthy in this way.<p>In terms of scalability, the three main contenders right now to be the next generation general purpose blockchain are Hashgraph, DFINITY, and RChain, with a couple dozen other dark horse contenders as well (protocol labs, eos, tezos, etc.) We don&#x27;t know if any of them actually work yet, in the same way we didn&#x27;t know whether or not Bitcoin was actually secure in 2010. But there is a bunch of stuff that will be launching in the next couple years and then slowly battle tested over the next decade while we figure out what really works.<p>Most consumer apps are still going to be driven just by Postgres or whatever, with data only validated on the chain when it actually needs to be. E.g. if you&#x27;re buying a house, it&#x27;s probably fine to take Zillow&#x27;s word on the transaction history if you&#x27;re just casually browsing, but then if you&#x27;re getting serious about buying you can always hit the button to go directly to the chain explorer or whatever.",

Think of each attempt at generating a nonce below the required difficulty as a lottery ticket. The more nonces you generate (the more hashes per second you compute) the higher your chance of winning. The system works because people who spent lots of money on lottery tickets in the past (and maybe won one or two times) are incentivized to keep the lottery running in an honest manner (so their prize keeps its value - if they haven&#x27;t spent it).<p>&gt; Along these lines one of the more intriguing projects is called RandHound[1].
